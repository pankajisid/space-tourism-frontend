# Space tourism website

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this multi-page space tourism website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

If you choose to use a JS-heavy approach, we provide a local `data.json` file for the different page data. This means you'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the separate `.html` files.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information
